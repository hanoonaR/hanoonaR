### Hi there 👋
I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Vision at MBZUAI. My current area of research is focused on exploring the potential of multi-modal understanding from vision and language to build scalable general-purpose vision systems, that continually learn and can generalize to various domains and downstream tasks using an open-vocabulary.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on Multi-Modal Transformers in Computer Vision Applications.
